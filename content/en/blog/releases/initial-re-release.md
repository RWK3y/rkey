Well if anything is certain and constant when it comes to me building or rather attempting to build a decent ***document*** web site that can also function as a ***landing page***, ***home page***, ***project community page***, and ***blog*** all in one while also learning development ***way to late in life***; It is that change is constant and my prerogative to change my mind is exercised to it's fullest extent.

This site started out as an ***Ananke*** themed site then morphed into a ***Docsy*** themed site, ***which I felt was overkill***, then morphed into a ***Congo*** themed site which was absolutely beautiful, but not very fitting for my use as a documentation site. Then I found ***Geekdocs*** which upon initial roll-out seemed perfect, but I kept getting small little things that just bugged the crap out of me and I could not figure out how to resolve in the limited time frame available.

So now I'm back on the ***Docsy*** theme and the ***overkill*** now seems juuuusssst right -- Shout out to their Goldydocs sample site :)

So for this week we will again be running on ***Docsy***.  Now I have to rewright the "Build Opekkt Tech" page.  The very first one ***again***.
